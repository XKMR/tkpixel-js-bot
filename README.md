# tkpixel-js-bot

A discord bot made with nodeJS using discord.js's library.<br/>
this bot has many functions, look them up using the '$t help' command.<br/>
I'm the developer of this bot, "darkHares#0001" on discord.<br/>
it's a quite simple bot.<br/>
this bot is designed for single server use only.<br/>
in order to use it you <b>need</b> to edit "config.json" and even the code a little bit.<br/>
to start the bot just run the "index.js" file with nodejs
